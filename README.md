# Burger of the Day App

## Project Overview
The Bob's Burgers Burger of the Day web app was created for the witty Bob's Burgers' fanatics who look forward to the "punny" Burger of the Day boards each episode and desire to bring those burgers to life in their own kitchens (or grills). When a user visits the Burger of the Day application, they will see a display of 30 Burger of the Day Boards which the filter by their favorite ingredient or an ingredient they happen to have in their pantry. 

## Context
I developed this project as my final showcase project at the end of Module 3 at the Turing School for Software Development and Design after 18 weeks as a front-end developer. The project took at approximately six days to completely from planning to documentation while balancing a full courseload.

## Learning Goals
Demonstrate proficiency of the following:
- React through displaying data from my API, allowing users to filter
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End-to-end testing with Cypress

I accomplished these learning goals by creating my own backend API in Express and using React to display data from my API, creating functionality that allows the user to filter recipes by ingredients, select a burger recipe, and navigate to a page that shows a description, serving size, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions to make the recipe. Using Router ensured that the user can move back and forth between the home view and recipe view. All user flows were tested in Cypress.
